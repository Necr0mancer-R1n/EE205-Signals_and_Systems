# EE205_Signals-Systems

The subject covers the fundamentals of signals and systems. The main objective is to gain knowledge of eight main <br>
topics: <br>
1. The fundamental of signals and systems, unit impulse function and unit step function, and system characterization <br>
2. The properties of linear time-invariant system, unit impulse response, and convolution <br>
3. The process and properties of Fourier series representation of periodic signals <br>
4. The process and properties of continuous-time Fourier transform <br>
5. The process and properties of discrete-time Fourier transform <br>
6. Sampling process and sampling theorem <br>
7. Amplitude modulation and frequency modulation in communication systems<br> 
8. Usage of Matlab functionality for analyzing signals and systems <br>
